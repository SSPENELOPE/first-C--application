# first-C--application

# Description
- This is my first C# application I am building and storing notes in as I learn and use my bootcamp continuation courses.

- As I continue to go through the learning process of dotnet and C# this repository will continue to change significantly. 

- So far this application uses the `dotnet run` command and is just a simple console logging and writing application using the built in terminal.

- I will update this README as the app changes

# Usage
- I will include instructions and screenshots when the application is finished

# Credits
- The instructors at the UofM Bootcamp for getting me started in my Coding career and a building a solid foundation in coding in which to grow on

- The University of Minnesota for providing awesome continuation courses in other programming languages
